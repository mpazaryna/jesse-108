Pete Torrano is a RYS-200 Certified Yoga Instructor.  He landed in yoga in 2017 after carrying a fish-tank from the basement of his house and making a twisting motion at the top of the stairs which landed him on the floor and in much pain.  His son Gian walked up to him and seeing him there said: "dad, try this movement, and now try that position" and dad, having nothing to lose, tried those things.  

That very same afternoon Pete was out shoveling snow in the driveway.  Then it dawned on him, waitaminute!  So he asked his son, what was that you had me do earlier when I twisted my back?  His son replied: _"oh, dad, that's just yoga!" 

And ever since then I have been studying and practicing yoga weekly several times a week!!  Pete learned that via the physical practice (called Asana) that one needed no special devices, gym equipment, locations nor memberships.  No excuse, because, no matter where we are, whether it be the beach, the woods, in a submarine or in a studio, we (our bodies) are our own pulleys, we are our own weights, our own gym.  

But soon Pete began to realize there's more to yoga than just the postures, breathing and movement, so he decided to explore the philosophy of yoga and how it all meshed together.  Seeing the big improvement it had on him, not only with the physical practice, but also the philosophy behind it, Pete decided to become a certified instructor and the rest became history. :D

Emma Mammano is an E-RYT with Yoga Alliance and has been teaching hatha yoga for 23
years. She received her certification from YogaFit, Inc., a California-based training company
that focuses on making yoga safe and accessible to all. She also worked for YogaFit as a
teacher trainer, traveling to various locations throughout the country to lead educational
workshops. Over the years Emma has pursued additional yoga training with Shiva Rea, learned
Buddhist mindfulness practice with Lama Tsultrim Allione, and studied non-dual Saiva Tantra
with Christopher “Hareesh” Wallis. Through her own healing journey, she has experienced the
profoundly positive effects of yoga practice for body and soul, which has made her extremely
passionate about sharing yogic tools with others. She takes pride in making her classes
welcoming, safe, and accessible for all yogis, and in seamlessly integrating the philosophical
traditions of yoga into the asana practice.

Emma also is a Masters Level mental health clinician, who integrates spirituality into her
counseling work. In her spare time, she studies Flamenco Dance with the Alborada Dance
Company and serves as the Vice Chair of the Ocean County Democratic Party. Her most

husband Ron, and dog Goose in the Midstreams section of Brick.

In 1982, I started a formal practice of meditation, which opened a door into the study of Vedanta Philosophy, Yoga, and many wellness practices. I taught my first Hatha Yoga class in 1985 at Seton Hall University.

In 1986, I moved to Washington, D.C., and attended classes at yoga centers throughout town. I became a participant and devotee at The Self Revelation Church of Absolute Monism and immersed myself more deeply into the studies and practices. The weekly service and programs highlighted Advaita Vedanta, Kriya Yoga, and the Universality of Soul. I performed Karma Yoga by working on the grounds and was a member of the Bell Choir.

In 2015, I returned to New Jersey and discovered many yoga studios near my new home. I completed my Yoga Teacher Training 200-hour certification in 2017 and immediately began teaching.

My teaching and practice interests are varied; I focus on beginning students and those with special needs. I am inspired by Swami Kamalananda ("Srimati Kamala"), Swami Premananda, Swami Satchidananda, Ram Dass, BKS Iyengar, and Pema Chodron.

In 1982, I began a formal meditation practice that opened the door to studying Vedanta Philosophy, Yoga, and various wellness practices. I taught my first Hatha Yoga class in 1985 at Seton Hall University.

After moving to Washington, D.C. in 1986, I explored various yoga centers throughout the city, immersing myself in different teaching styles and traditions. During this time, I deepened my understanding of Vedanta philosophy and meditation practices through regular study and practice. These years provided valuable insights into traditional yoga philosophy while helping me develop a strong foundation in meditation techniques.

In 2015, I returned to New Jersey and discovered numerous yoga studios near my new home. After completing my 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training certification in 2017, I immediately began teaching.

My teaching and practice interests are diverse; I focus on beginning students and those with special needs. My inspiration comes from Swami Kamalananda ("Srimati Kamala"), Swami Premananda, Swami Satchidananda, Ram Dass, BKS Iyengar, and Pema Chodron.

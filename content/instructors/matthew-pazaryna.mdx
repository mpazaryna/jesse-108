In 1982, I began a formal meditation practice that led to my study of Vedanta Philosophy and Yoga. I taught my first Hatha Yoga class in 1985 at Seton Hall University.

After moving to Washington, D.C., in 1986, I explored yoga centers throughout the city, immersing myself in different teaching styles and traditions. I deepened my understanding of Vedanta philosophy and meditation practices during this time.

In 2015, after moving back to New Jersey, I was excited to find many yoga studios close to my new home. I completed my 200-hour yoga teacher training certification in 2017 and started teaching right away.

My teaching and practice interests are diverse; I focus on beginning students and those with special needs. I am inspired by the teachings of Srimati Kamala, Swami Satchidananda, Ram Dass, BKS Iyengar, and Pema Chodron.

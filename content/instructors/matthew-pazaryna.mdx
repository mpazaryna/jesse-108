In 1982, I began a formal meditation practice that opened the door to studying Vedanta Philosophy, Yoga, and various wellness practices. I taught my first Hatha Yoga class in 1985 at Seton Hall University.

After moving to Washington, D.C. in 1986, I attended classes at yoga centers throughout the city. I became a devoted participant at The Self Revelation Church of Absolute Monism, deepening my studies and practices. The weekly services and programs emphasized Advaita Vedanta, Kriya Yoga, and the Universality of Soul. I performed Karma Yoga by maintaining the grounds and joined the Bell Choir.

In 2015, I returned to New Jersey and discovered numerous yoga studios near my new home. After completing my 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training certification in 2017, I immediately began teaching.

My teaching and practice interests are diverse; I focus on beginning students and those with special needs. My inspiration comes from Swami Kamalananda ("Srimati Kamala"), Swami Premananda, Swami Satchidananda, Ram Dass, BKS Iyengar, and Pema Chodron.

# Small business, Big personality

We load and truck all fruit and vegetable fiber to the local community garden Kula Farms. Our waste aides composting and soil preservation. Itâ€™s messy but we love this! Our employee education and mentoring of life path choices, aim to create caring voices of authority.

For wholesale accounts juices are HPP (Highly Pressurized Process), a heat-free method of pressurization in removing potentially harmful pathogens while maintaining all the nutritional benefits. Ensuring delicate immune systems in pregnant women and children.

We only use USDA organic certified FRESH ingredients, that means we never use frozen products or co-packers to do our work. We monitor all juice recipe pH levels and we control temperature levels within our facilities and during refrigerated transportation.

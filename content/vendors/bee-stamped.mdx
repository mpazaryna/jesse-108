I am a local artist/small business owner of Bee Stamped by Dawn. I make handcrafted vintage spoon rings and other amazing creations all made from vintage silverware. My handmade gifts and jewelry can be found on my Facebook & Instagram page Bee Stamped by Dawn as well as at my many pop up events throughout Ocean and Monmouth County. Stop by and catch some Bee Love and see what all the cool kids are talking about.

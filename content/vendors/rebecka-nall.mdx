Rebecka LaFluer is a multidisciplinary artist crafting portals to other worlds. Rooted in experimentation, her practice explores the boundaries of material, texture, and perception. Each piece is a layered construction of paint,
sculpted form, and emotional residue that invites the viewer into a space where magic and melancholy intertwine.

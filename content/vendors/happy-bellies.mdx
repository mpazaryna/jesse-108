Happy Bellies Jars is a family-owned and operated business born from a true passion for creating delicious, homemade jams and butters.

Proudly based in Central New Jersey, owners Erik and Heather began their journey in December 2019 at the Marlboro Farmers Market. What started as a small venture has grown into a thriving business with a loyal and supportive customer base.

At Happy Bellies Jars, every product is crafted with love, care, and only the finest ingredients. We understand how important it is to know whatâ€™s in your food, and we are dedicated to offering high-quality products that are vegan and gluten-free, with sugar-free options coming soon.

Our commitment to quality is matched only by our dedication to our community. What began at the farmers market has blossomed into lasting relationships with customers who trust and know us personally.

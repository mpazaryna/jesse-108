## Tuliptree cafe

Our goals associated with a farm to table mission are to maintain a food’s organic health benefits and nutritional quality, improve the economic strength of local farms, avoid the use of genetically modified foods, increase the variety in the types of foods available to a region, and decrease the environmental influence and carbon footprint of factory farms and mass food production. The café features the freshest ingredients procured from local farms, on site gardens and high quality fruit and produce markets.
We offer a community garden, education on growing, harvesting, cooking and composting. Supporting health and nutrition the Tulip Tree Café works in unison with the Calgo Gardens Community. The Tulip Tree Café seeks out relationships with local farms; we want to know where our food is grown and who grows it.
The Tulip Tree Café operates at Calgo Gardens in Howell township NJ, accompanying the nursery, farm, gift shop, aquaponic greenhouses, industrial repurpose and landscape design/build services found at Calgo Gardens. Calgo Gardens offers its serene space at no charge to various non-profit, community and religious groups and schools.

The Sourdough Streets brings the art of traditional bread-making to your neighborhood. We specialize in handcrafted sourdough bread and pastries, using time-honored techniques and the finest ingredients.

We believe in the magic of slow fermentation and the importance of preserving traditional bread-making methods. Each loaf is carefully crafted by hand, using our own sourdough starter that has been nurtured for years. Our bread-making process includes natural fermentation, long slow proofing, and stone hearth baking.

We offer artisanal sourdough bread, seasonal pastries, specialty loaves, bread-making workshops, and custom orders. Every product reflects our commitment to quality ingredients and attention to detail.

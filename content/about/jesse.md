Join us on May 18, 2025, for a heartfelt Muscular Dystrophy fundraiser at YogaBlissLove, Calgo Gardens and In -
bloom garden center. We'll begin the day with 108 yoga salutations for charity from
8:30-10 AM, channeling energy and intention for a meaningful cause. Afterward,
explore an incredible selection of products from our specialty vendors and sponsors.

All proceeds will support the Muscular Dystrophy Association in memory of Jesse and in honor of Ayler. Let's move, give, and
make a difference together!

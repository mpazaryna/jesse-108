Please join us for a heartfelt day of movement, mindfulness, and community as YogaBlissLove hosts a Muscular Dystrophy Fundraiser in memory of my beloved son Jesse, and in honor of my son Ayler, who continues to inspire us every day.

This special event will take place on Sunday, May 18th, 2025, at YogaBlissLove, nestled in the beautiful gardens of Calgo Gardens. All proceeds will benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) in support of families, research, and hope.

Event Schedule:

8:00 AM – Opening Circle & Introductions

We’ll gather in love and remembrance. A special guest from the MDA will share a few words on the impact of your support.

8:30 AM – 108 Sun Salutations for Charity

Led by a powerful lineup of yoga teachers, this moving meditation of 108 sun salutations is a sacred number symbolizing spiritual completion and unity. Move at your own pace, rest when needed, and feel the strength of community.

10:00 AM – 2:00 PM – Local Vendors, Wellness & Community

Enjoy a vibrant marketplace featuring handmade goods, delicious bites, and holistic offerings. Lunch is available from the incredible Tulip Tree Café just steps away.
